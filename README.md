This project was part of my Database Systems Design and Management course in the fall of 2024. This part of the project was built off of a supplied template and methods interfacing with our own MySQL database we created as a part of the class.

The goal of this database was for my own personal use to keep track of my own rock specimens while connecting them to scientific data regarding the specimen's component parts. 
Currently, the database design is in a working state with room to add additional aspects like pictures of the specimen.
The GUI supports the addition, deletion, and modification of specimens within the MySQL database, but requires more work for adding definitions and other relations with a particular specimen.

This database is meant to be operated locally and should not be used to hold sensitive data, as it does not provide the proper security, access verification, and encryption needed for a shared database. As a part of the requirements for the project, the gui does provide an insecure login page that uses information within the database which should be disconnected and secured if it is to be used in the future.
